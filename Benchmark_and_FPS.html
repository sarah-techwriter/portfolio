            <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">You're staring at GPU benchmarks showing "85 FPS" and "127 FPS" - but what do these numbers actually mean for your gaming? Here's how to decode those performance figures.</p>

                    &bull; 60 FPS is the sweet spot for most gamers, offering a major improvement over 30 FPS.

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">FPS Breakdown: What Each Number Means</h2>
                    <p>The 30 FPS tier represents bare minimum playability. It feels choppy during fast action sequences, like watching a stuttery movie. This frame rate works for turn-based strategy games, but becomes painful during first-person shooters. Most gamers target 60 FPS as the sweet spot for smooth gameplay. The jump in fluidity from 30 to 60 FPS is immediately noticeable and transformative. This frame rate works great for most games and perfectly matches standard 60 Hz monitors. Competitive players push for 120+ FPS to gain that ultra-responsive edge. The improvement over 60 FPS is noticeable but not as dramatic as the 30-to-60 jump. You need a high-refresh monitor to see the full benefit. Frame consistency matters more than peak numbers. A game averaging 60 FPS with frequent dips to 30 FPS feels worse than a rock-solid 45 FPS throughout your session.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Reading Benchmark Charts Like a Pro</h2>
                    <p>Don’t get distracted by just the average FPS headline number. The story lies in the details that reveal real-world performance. Look at the 1% lows, which show worst-case performance during intense gaming moments. Frame time consistency prevents that jarring stutter that ruins immersion. The premium usually offers better ray tracing performance, more VRAM for future games, superior upscaling technology like DLSS versus FSR, and lower power consumption.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Resolution Reality Check</h2>
                    <p>Your target resolution dramatically affects performance across all GPU tiers. The same graphics card can deliver vastly different experiences depending on pixel count. At 1080p, you’ll see high frame rates but often hit CPU limitations with powerful GPUs. The 1440p sweet spot balances visual quality with performance, making GPU differences more apparent. 4K gaming demands maximum GPU horsepower and creates large performance gaps between graphics cards. Consider this example: The RTX 5090 averages 157 FPS at 1080p but drops to 106 FPS at 4K. Same card, same game, massive difference in performance.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Smart Buying Strategy</h2>
                    <p>Match your frame rate expectations to your actual gaming habits. Story-driven games run perfectly fine at 30-60 FPS, while action games benefit from 60-90 FPS for responsiveness. Competitive esports players gain meaningful advantages at 120+ FPS, and VR gaming demands 90+ FPS to prevent motion sickness. VRAM capacity determines your card’s longevity across future games. Target 8GB minimum for 1080p gaming, though 12GB provides better future-proofing. High-resolution 1440p and 4K gaming really benefit from 16GB VRAM to handle ultra settings and next-generation titles. Don’t ignore your monitor’s capabilities when choosing a GPU. There’s no point in buying 144 FPS performance for a 60 Hz display. Match your graphics card investment to your actual display hardware.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Bottom Line</h2>
                    <p>60 FPS hits the sweet spot for most gamers. Higher FPS provides diminishing returns unless you’re competitive gaming or have a high-refresh monitor. Your resolution choice matters more than raw FPS numbers—a stable 60 FPS at 1440p often beats inconsistent 100 FPS at 4K. Focus on consistent performance over peak numbers, and match your GPU choice to your actual monitor and gaming preferences.</p>
